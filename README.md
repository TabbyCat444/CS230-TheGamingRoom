# CS230-TheGamingRoom - Java project for CS-230: Operating Platforms


### Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was a client with an exsiting Android gamae app called Draw It or Lose It. The idea of the game is to compete with others on successfully guessing the image being rendered at certain pace by the program. This company wanted to expand their game to reach a larger larger audience via a multiple-platform web application.


### What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

The parts I feel like I handled the best in creating appropriate documentation was assessing the clients needs and limitations for their product, as well as documentation regarding server side requirements and restrictions.


### What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The most convenient part of having created a design document when developing the code, for me, was having one place with all the requirements, restrictions, and notes regarding the software being developed.


### If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would likely revise the section regarding development tools the most, while I would need to do more research to make any changes, it was noted that a more in-dpeth look at various IDEs and programming languages available to differnt operating systems would be useful in this section.


### How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I made recommendations regarding security and memory and storage management with the user in mind. These options accomadate concerns regarding privacy and safety as well as compensating for the desired to have a smooth operating experience while playing the game.


### How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

This was my first attempt at a full software design document, and before making my next one I would like to learn more about the differences between operating systems and the sorts of requirements needed for releasing compatible software. However, I will keep this general template for now I practice creating documentation for future development projects.
